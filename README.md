### This a hobby project, and should not be seen or used as any kind of publicly available service.

Lensfer is a very basic image hosting app built as a fun weekend project. 

It stores uploaded files in an s3 bucket and serves them via a public share link.

Lensfer uses Ruby on Rails as an API with a React/Redux front end using Typescript, and runs on Docker.
